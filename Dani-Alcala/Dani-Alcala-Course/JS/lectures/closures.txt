As a math enthusiast
I want to increase and decrease a number
So that I can quickly know the number before and after

Acceptance Criteria

Scenario #1: Increment

Given a function
When I send the number <number>
Then I can see in the console the <incremented> number

number-incremented
0-'The result is 1'
1-'The result is 2'
3-'The result is 4'
10-'The result is 11'

Scenario #2: Decrement

Given a function
When I send the number <number>
Then I can see in the console the <decremented> number

number-decrement
2-'The result is 1'
3-'The result is 2'
5-'The result is 4'
12-'The result is 11'


[BONUS] Scenario #3 Custom Answer

Given a function fnUpAndDown
When I input a <number> and an <operation>
Then a <message> is displayed in the console

number-operation-message
2-decrement-'The decrement is 01'
1-decrement-'The decrement is 00'
5-decrement-'The decrement is 04'
5-increment-'The increment is 06'
10-decrement-'The decrement is 09'
10-increment-'The increment is 11'
